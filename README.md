# Data-Structure-Visualizer

A Data Structure and Algorithm Visualizer which helps the userto have a better understanding of the daily life data
structures and and algorithms by allowing the user to step by step implement the data structures and algorithms with
customized speed of the algorithm implementation.
Build using Python and Tkinter and Graphviz GUI,the data structure it covers are stack, queue, trees, graphs(directed
undirected) and algorithms like bubble sort, merge sort and quick sort.

You'll need to install "pydot" and "graphviz"(only through conda, not pip !!) in order to run the 'graph_trees.py' file.
